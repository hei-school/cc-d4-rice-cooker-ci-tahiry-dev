# Rice Cooker Application Management

> This program emulates the functionality of a rice cooker within a terminal environment, offering a streamlined and user-friendly experience for rice preparation.


## App functionality

- Upon program initiation, users will be prompted to select their desired type of rice for cooking
- Subsequently, they will have the option to specify the quantity of rice to be prepared
- Following this input, a brief waiting period ensues, culminating in the completion of the rice cooking process. Enjoy the freshly cooked rice with utmost convenience. !!!

## Prerequisities

To get this project up and running locally, you must have the following programs installed on your machine:
    - [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
    - [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
    - [swift](https://www.swift.org/install/)

## Getting Started

**To get this project set up on your local machine, follow these simple steps:**

**Step 1**<br>
Navigate through the local folder where you want to clone the repository and run<br>
`git clone https://github.com/hei-school/cc-d4-rice-cooker-ci-tahiry-dev.git`. It will clone the repo to your local folder.<br>
**Step 2**<br>
get inside the local folder where you cloned the repository. Within the project, you'll find five branches. Each branch, apart from the main branch, is dedicated to a specific programming language: `feature/typescript`, `feature/go`, `feature/dart`, `feature/swift`. 
Choose your preferred branch and follow the next steps to run the program.
**Step 3**<br>
Running the program depends on the branch, i.e., the programming language you have chosen. Let's break down each branch:

  ### feature/typescript:
       - The first step is to run the following command in your terminal: `npm install`
       - Now you can run the program with this command: `node dist/riceCooker.js`

  ### feature/go:
       - Launching the app is quite easy once you meet the requirements, please type this command: `go run main.go`

  ### feature/dart:
      - Once you meet the requirements, please type this command: `dart rice_cooker.dart`

  ### feature/swift:
      - After everything is installed, launch the following command: `./RiceCookerSimulator `
      

## Linter Testing

Each programming language has its unique process for launching tests. Let's explore each one individually.

  ### feature/typescript:
       with this command `npm run lint`
       
  ### feature/go:
      with this command: `golangci-lint run main.go`

  ### feature/dart:
       with this command: `dart analyze` 
       
  ### feature/swift:
    with this command: `swiftlint`
